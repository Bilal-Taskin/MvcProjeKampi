# 💻 100-Lesson C# ASP.NET MVC Project Bootcamp

This repository contains all the code, lessons, and project files created during the 100-lesson ASP.NET MVC Project Camp by [Murat Yücedağ on YouTube].

This project serves as a full practice for building a web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern in C#.

## ✨ Technologies Used

This project uses modern Microsoft development tools and frameworks:

* **Programming Language:** C# (C Sharp)
* **Web Framework:** ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller Architecture)
* **Database Access:** Entity Framework (Code First or Database First approach)
* **Database System:** Microsoft SQL Server
* **Frontend Basics:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and often Bootstrap for styling.

## 📚 Key Learning Modules (Course Content)

The bootcamp covered a wide range of topics essential for enterprise-level development. Here are the main skills demonstrated in this repository:

* **MVC Architecture:** Understanding how Models, Views, and Controllers work together.
* **Database Operations (CRUD):** Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting records using Entity Framework.
* **Validation:** Checking user inputs and ensuring data integrity.
* **Routing:** Setting up custom URLs and connecting them to controller actions.
* **Layout & Views:** Designing reusable layouts and dynamic pages with Razor syntax.
* **Security & Authorization:** Implementing basic user roles and security features (if covered in the course).

## ⚙️ Local Setup and Running the Project

To run this ASP.NET MVC project, you need to set up a few things on your computer:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Visual Studio (2019 or newer)
    * SQL Server (or SQL Server Express)
2.  **Clone the Code:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/murat-yucedag-mvc-bootcamp.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/murat-yucedag-mvc-bootcamp.git)
    ```
3.  **Database Connection:**
    * Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.
    * Update the database connection string in the **`Web.config`** file to match your local SQL Server settings.
    * Run any database migrations if needed (or ensure your SQL database is created).
4.  **Run:**
    * Start the project (usually by pressing **F5** or the "Start" button in Visual Studio). The application should open in your default browser.
